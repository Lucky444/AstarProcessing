# AstarProcessing
A very simple A* pathfinder, written in processing.

**This is not finished, there are still some bugs and ways to make it more efficent, but I can't be bothered to rewrite everything**

**How to use**
Press 1 to select the starting node and place it on the grid,
Press 2 to select the blocked node and draw something, idk
Press 3 to select finish node and place it on the grid

When you are done, press space and it will start the pathfinding algorithm. I have artiffically slowed down the program to make it prettier to look at. You can change the speed with wich the algorithm runs, by adjusteing the frameRate variable on the top of the program
